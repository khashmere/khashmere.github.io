Brand guidelines for Khashmere materials (proposals, presentations, documents). Ensures consistency across all brand touchpoints with warm, trustworthy, simple feel.

## Brand Thinking

Before designing, understand the emotional goal:

**What should someone feel in 10 seconds?**
"I can start here. They handle the hard parts."

**What problem do we solve?**
AI and data feel overwhelming. People don't know where to start.

**What should they believe?**
This is simple. These are real people I can trust.

**Tagline:** Human-first data platform. Comfortable expertise.

## Values & Voice

**Values:**
- Human-first — technology serves people, not the reverse
- Trustworthy — smart, nice, good communicators
- Simple — don't overwhelm people already overwhelmed

**Voice:**
Sound like an expert who solves the right problem, not just the obvious one. Plain language, direct, confident. Lead with strategy, follow with execution. Acknowledge complexity then simplify it.

**Don't:** Buzzwords, jargon, over-explaining, cold/robotic tone.

## Visual Identity

### Colors

```css
/* Primary palette */
--soft-navy: #3d4f61;   /* Primary background */
--deep-navy: #1f2d3a;   /* Gradients, depth */
--warm-cream: #f0ece8;  /* Text on dark */
--warm-gold: #d4af82;   /* Accents, highlights */
```

### Typography

**Font:** DM Sans (400, 500)

- Logo: 16px / 500 / letter-spacing: 2px
- H1: 28-32px / 400
- Body: 15-16px / 400
- Small: 12-13px / 400

Use *italics* for emphasis. Use warm gold for key words. Avoid bold.

### Logo

**KHASHMERE** (all caps, letter-spacing: 2-3px)

- On dark: `#f0ece8` (warm cream)
- On light: `#1f2d3a` (deep navy)

## Application

- **Proposals/Docs:** Light background okay, navy headers, gold accent lines, generous margins
- **Presentations:** Dark slides for impact, light for detail, one idea per slide, avoid bullets

## Quick Check

- Does this feel warm and approachable?
- Would someone overwhelmed by AI feel calm looking at this?
- Is this simple enough?
- Does every visual choice connect back to the feeling we want?
